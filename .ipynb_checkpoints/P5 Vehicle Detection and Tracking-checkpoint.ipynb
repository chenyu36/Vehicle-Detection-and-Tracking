    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to the HOG feature vector.\n",
    "* Normalize the features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run the pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected."
